Matfis, MD\nQuincy Office\nHarvard Vanguard Medical Associates\n\n\nTRIGLYCERIDES AND HYPERTRIGLYCERIDEMIA (HVMA)\n\nWhat are triglycerides?\nTriglycerides comprise much of the fats in foods such as butter, margarine and oils. They are also the storage form of fat in our bodies. Hypertriglyceridemia (hyper - too much and emia - in blood), an excess of triglycerides in the blood, may increase the risk of heart disease and at very high levels cause abdominal pain and pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas).\nTriglycerides are measured as part of a fasting lipid profile, which requires at least nine hours of fasting before the test to obtain accurate results. Other factors affecting triglyceride levels include the quantity of alcohol, fat, and sweets consumed 48-hours before the test. These values therefore tend to be much more variable than other lipid values, such as total cholesterol, HDL (good) and LDL (bad) cholesterol.\n\nWhile the role of triglycerides as an independent risk factor for heart disease remains subject to debate, elevations of this fat often go hand-in-hand with other risk factors such as obesity, low levels of good HDL cholesterol and diabetes mellitus.\n\nWhat causes blood triglyceride levels to rise?\n\n· Saturated fats - triglycerides are fats, so a fat-rich meal is a triglyceride-rich meal. Sources of saturated fats include:\n\nanimal products such as meats and high-fat dairy foods\ntropical oils (palm, coconut)\nhydrogenated oils (present in processed foods)\n· Excess calories - calories not used right away for energy get transformed into triglycerides and stored as fat.\n\n· Carbohydrates - excess amounts of carbohydrates (rice, pasta, breads, etc.) and concentrated sweets get converted to triglycerides in the liver.\n\n· Alcohol - when you drink alcohol, the liver produces triglycerides that circulate in the blood. Variations in genetic makeup determine whether alcohol has a minor or extreme effect on triglyceride levels.\n\nHow do I know if I have high triglycerides?\nTriglyceride levels below 150 mg/dl are considered normal. Values above this range include borderline high (150-199), high 200-499, and very high (500 and above). The risk of abdominal pain and pancreatitis begins at levels of about 1000.\n\nWhat can I do if I have high triglyceride levels?\nWhile high cholesterol levels are often treated with medication, high triglyceride levels usually respond best to diet and exercise. Very high levels or the presence of other risk factors may indicate use of medication at somewhat lower abnormal values. Medications can supplement diet, but alone will not generally solve the problem.\n\nThere are several things you can do to lower your high triglyceride level and improve your lipid profile. Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates recommends the following lifestyle changes:\n\nLose excess weight, preferably through a combination of calorie restriction and physical activity.\nExercise regularly; exercise facilitates weight loss and may lower your triglyceride level and raise your HDL (good) cholesterol level.\nAvoid foods that are highly concentrated in carbohydrates, such as chocolates, honey, syrups, table and powdered sugar, molasses, jams and jellies, candy, frostings, donuts, pies, cakes, pastries and cookies, jello, sherbets, sorbet, frozen yogurt and ice cream, regular soda and other sweet drinks. Limit fruit juices to 4-8 ounces per day and fruit to 3 servings/day (one serving of fruit equals one small apple, banana or peach or ½ can of fruit without syrup). You should also limit your encounter of pasta, rice, breads, potatoes, corn, beans, etc. to one to two servings/meal (one serving equals ½ cup of pasta or rice, 1 slice of bread or 1 cup dry cereal). Try to use whole wheat or grain rather than white bread and brown rather than white rice.\nAvoid foods high in saturated fats, such as animal products (meats and high-fat dairy foods), tropical oils (palm, coconut) and hydrogenated oils (present in processed foods)\nEat more fatty fish, including bass, bluefish, cod, flounder, haddock, halibut, herring, mackerel, red snapper, salmon, trout and tuna. Omega-3 fatty acids found in these types of fish may lower your triglyceride level. Fish should be baked or broiled, not fried.\nAvoid alcohol or only drink occasionally and in moderation. In some patients, even small amounts of alcohol can dramatically raise the triglyceride level.\nAvoid smoking, a healthy choice that will make regular exercise easier and help raise HDL (good) cholesterol levels.\nHVMA reviewed/revised: A.
